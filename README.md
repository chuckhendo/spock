Spock
============

A Grunt GUI Tool forked from [@willerce](http://github.com/willerce/spock).

Spock is a GUI frontend for Grunt. Unlike Koala and Prepros, Spock merely provides a graphic interface, without adding any extra functionality.

Instead of Grunt's original command line interface, Spock's graphic interface helps the new Grunt users. We hope Spock can promote the usage of Grunt. 

Download release [here](http://github.com/CloudKidStudio/spock/releases).

##Getting started

First, you shoud install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally. [Grunt CLI Installation Details](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then, Change to the existing Grunt project's root directory, Install project dependencies with `npm install`

To Ensure Run Grunt with `grunt` is okay.

Last, Open Spock and drag project folder to Spock to add it. Run the task from Spock Task area.

**Mac OS X** 

Please run the command shell before use Spock.

```
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/grunt /usr/bin/grunt
```
